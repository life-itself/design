# Life Itself Main Website — Short Brief

## Situation

Life Itself encompasses multiple initiatives (research, hubs, courses, events), with substantial activity but no current, live, coherent web front in the new system.

## Complication

Attempting to make the main site “explain everything” triggers unresolved identity, governance, and narrative questions, slowing delivery and blocking shipping.

## Question

What is the minimal version of the Life Itself website that can be shipped now and still do its job?

## Answer

The main Life Itself website functions as a **hub-of-hubs**, not a content host.

## Scope (in)

* Orientation: what Life Itself is at a high level
* Credibility: who is involved, signals of seriousness
* Navigation: clear links to sub-sites (research, etc.)
* Newsletter / contact / basic calls to action

## Scope (out)

* Deep exposition of vision or philosophy
* Hosting research outputs
* Courses, hubs, residencies beyond signposting
* Identity or governance resolution

## Audience

Curious newcomers, collaborators, funders, partners.

## Definition of done (this phase)

* Live site on FlowerShow-style stack
* Clear navigation and links
* Coherent visual language
* Easy to update and extend
