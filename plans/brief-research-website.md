# Life Itself Research Sub-site — Brief

## Situation

Life Itself conducts ongoing research with collaborators, outputs, and a distinct epistemic posture, but currently lacks a dedicated public home in the new web system.

## Complication

Embedding research directly within the main Life Itself website blurs audiences, slows iteration, and risks reopening unresolved questions about overall identity and narrative.

## Question

Why a separate research sub-site, and what must it deliver now?

## Answer

The research sub-site is a **distinct public home for inquiry**, provisionally separate in order to maximise clarity, speed, and focus.

## Rationale for separation

* Distinct audience (researchers, funders, intellectually engaged readers)
* Different cadence (ongoing inquiry rather than orientation)
* Enables shipping without resolving whole-organisation identity
* Architectural separation remains reversible later

## Scope (in)

* Clear framing of research purpose and approach
* Core pages (about, themes, people, outputs)
* Initial content live and navigable
* Visual coherence with Life Itself, without being subordinated to the main site

## Scope (out)

* Full academic polish
* Final or exhaustive research taxonomy
* Integration with courses, hubs, or residencies

## Audience

Researchers, intellectual collaborators, aligned institutions, and serious readers.

## Definition of done (this phase)

* Live, publicly accessible site
* Research identity legible within a single visit
* Content easily editable and extensible
* Designed for iteration, not perfection

## Jobs to be done (landing page + site)

### Primary jobs

* As a researcher or intellectual collaborator, quickly understand what this research collective is, how it thinks, and what it is working on.
* As a funder or institutional ally, assess seriousness, coherence, people, and outputs within one visit.
* As a prospective collaborator, see how to engage (calls, reading groups, brown bags, contact).

### Secondary jobs

* As a returning reader, find recent outputs (papers, essays, notebooks, talks).
* As a member of the collective, have a stable public home to point to and publish from.

### Non-jobs (explicitly not optimizing for, now)

* Mass onboarding or public education.
* Marketing funnels, courses, or community-building features.
* Exhaustive archival completeness.

### Implied landing page components

* Clear one-sentence research orientation (epistemic stance + domain).
* Prominent list of recent or flagship outputs (papers, essays, notebooks).
* People (core contributors, collaborators).
* Lightweight participation hooks (subscribe, attend a talk, contact).
* Signals of seriousness (cadence, continuity, intellectual lineage).

## Brand identity and feel

### Direction A: Quiet research institute (closest to Meaning Alignment)

* Minimal, calm typography; generous whitespace.
* Muted, warm palette; restrained gradients.
* Language emphasizes inquiry, alignment, and long-term questions.
* Feels legible to funders and senior researchers.
  Best if: you want institutional credibility and continuity with adjacent research orgs.

### Direction B: Living inquiry lab

* Still minimal, but more “working notebook” energy.
* Clear separation between finished outputs and in-progress thinking.
* Emphasis on cadence, questions, and open threads.
* Slightly more visible structure (themes, notebooks, talks).
  Best if: you want to foreground inquiry-as-process rather than authority.

### Direction C: Embedded but autonomous Life Itself research

* Visual continuity with Life Itself, but reduced narrative flourish.
* Research-first tone; fewer metaphors, more clarity.
* Signals reversibility and integration later.
  Best if: this is a provisional separation with likely reintegration.

### Our recommendation, based on the brief

Start with A + B: institutional calm with visible ongoing inquiry. This matches stated goals of clarity, speed, and reversibility, while avoiding premature narrative closure.
