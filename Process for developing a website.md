# Process for developing a website

Developing a research-focused website like **Life Itself** requires a balance between intellectual depth and user accessibility. While there is no single "correct" order, following a structured design process prevents rework and ensures the site feels cohesive.

The most effective approach is generally **Content-First Design**. Here is the recommended sequence to build a professional research site.

### Summary Table: The Best Workflow

| Phase | Task | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **1. Define** | Brand Brief | Establishes the goals and voice. |
| **2. Structure** | Sitemap & Content | Ensures the research is the star of the show. |
| **3. Plan** | Wireframes | Maps out the user experience (UX). |
| **4. Inspire** | Mood Board | Sets the visual direction (UI). |
| **5. Build** | Development | Turning the design into a functional site. |

### Why not just "see what gets generated"?

While AI and site generators are powerful, research sites often fail when they look too "templated." If your work is groundbreaking, the vessel carrying it should feel intentional. Generative tools are best used at **Phase 4** to help brainstorm visual styles, rather than at Phase 1 to define the logic.

## 1. The Strategy (Start Here)

Before you look at other sites, you need to define the "why." A **Brand Brief** is essential, but it shouldn't be passive. It should answer:

* **Who is the audience?** (Academics, policymakers, or the general public?)
* **What is the primary goal?** (Publishing papers, attracting funding, or building a community?)

## 2. Content & Information Architecture

For research sites, content is the foundation. If you design the "boxes" before you have the text, you’ll find that your complex research doesn't fit into generic templates.

* **Draft the Core Content:** Write out your mission statement, key research themes, and bios.
* **Sitemap:** Create a simple tree diagram showing how pages connect (e.g., Home > Research > Projects > Archive).

## 3. Wireframing (The Skeleton)

Now, build the "blueprint" without colors or fonts. This allows you to focus purely on the **user journey**.

* How does a visitor find a specific paper?
* Is the navigation intuitive?
* **Why this comes before the mood board:** You need to know *what* you are styling before you decide *how* to style it.

## 4. Mood Board (The Vibe)

Once you know the structure, gather visual inspiration. For a research site, you want to balance **authority** with **innovation**.

* Collect typography that looks scholarly but modern.
* Look for data visualization styles you admire.
* Decide on a color palette (e.g., muted "earthy" tones for a life-science feel, or high-contrast "tech" tones for modern research).

## 5. Design & Prototyping

Combine the wireframe and the mood board to create the high-fidelity design. This is where "Life Itself" gains its unique visual identity.
